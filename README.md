Python implementation of the Vigenère Cipher.
# 🔐 Vigenère Cipher Encryptor & Decryptor

This project demonstrates the **Vigenère Cipher**, a classic method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on a keyword.

---

## 💡 What is the Vigenère Cipher?

The Vigenère cipher is a **polyalphabetic substitution cipher** that uses a **keyword** to shift each letter of the message.

For example, with the keyword `KEY`, the message `HELLO` becomes `RIJVS`.

---

## 📌 Features

- Encrypts messages using Vigenère Cipher
- Decrypts messages back to original form
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation)

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python vigenere_cipher.py
